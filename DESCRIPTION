Description: 'plaid' (Pathway Level Average Intensity Detection) is an ultra-fast method to compute single-sample enrichment scores for gene expression or proteomics data. For each sample, plaid computes the gene set score as the average intensity of the genes/proteins in the gene set. The output is a gene set score matrix suitable for further analyses.
